    The Participants page

Here is an overview of the important features of the Participants page:

* The **Participants Search panel** â€” includes three buttons that give you easy access to participants that you often need to view:
   + the **All Participants** button - displays a list of all the participants in the Onyx database
   + the **Appointments of the day** button - displays a list of all the participants who have appointments on today's date
   + the **Interview in progress** button - displays a list of all the participants whose interviews have the status In progress
* The Participant Search field and  button - allow you to to search for a particular patient by name or ID
* The Participants list occupies the lower part of the page. Initially, it is empty, but after you do a search, it is filled with a list of participants.
* The Actions column contains one or more action links beside each participant. These are the actions you can do for the participant---for example: View their registration information and Interview them.
* The Page selection links (  ). If the Participants list contains many participants, they are displayed on several pages. These links allow you to view the different pages.
* A Locked interview (indicated by a small  icon) means that some user is interviewing the participant. See Locked status.
