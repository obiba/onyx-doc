Viewing Participants
====================
Onyx stores information about participants in its database on a server computer located in the assessment centre. All Onyx workstations can access the database.
The Participants page allows you to view a list of the participants in the database and to find individual participants so that you can view or edit their registration information, and work on their interviews.
