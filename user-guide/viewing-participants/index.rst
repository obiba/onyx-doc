Viewing Participants
====================
Onyx stores information about participants in its database on a server computer located in the assessment centre. All Onyx workstations can access the database.
The Participants page allows you to view a list of the participants in the database and to find individual participants so that you can view or edit their registration information, and work on their interviews.
This chapter includes these topics related to viewing participants in the **Participants** page:

* The :doc:`Participants page <the-participants-page>` and its important features
* :doc:`Key concepts <key-concepts>` related to viewing participants
* Procedures related to viewing participants
