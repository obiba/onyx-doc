|proc| Unlocking an interview
=============================
When a staff member is in the middle of an interview stage with a participant, that staff member has a lock on the interview.
This prevents conflicts in storing data. Occasionally, you may need to unlock an interview.
For example, a technical problem may be preventing the interview from being released, or the staff member who has a lock on the interview is not able to continue the interview.
A participant manager can unlock the interview as explained in this section.

Prerequisite
------------
You are an Onyx user of type participant manager.

Procedure
---------
#. If the **Participants** page is not displayed, select the **Participants** tab to display it.
