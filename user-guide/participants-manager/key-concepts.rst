Key concepts
============
This section contains concepts of interest to participant managers.

|key|  Receiving vs. Enrolling a Participant
--------------------------------------------
Some studies invite people to participate in the study and set up appointments to interview them.
These participants are added to the Onyx database when the appointment list is updated (see :doc:`Updating the Appointment List <updating-the-appointment-list>`).
When a participant arrives at the centre for their interview, a participant manager receives them.
Receiving a participant involves finding the participant in Onyx, assigning a Participant ID, and checking some information about the participant that Onyx already obtained from the appointment list.
See :doc:`Receiving a Participant <receiving-a-participant>`.
Some studies accept volunteer or walk-in participants. When a volunteer participant arrives at an assessment centre, a participant manager must enroll them.
Enrolling a participant involves assigning a Participant ID and entering some information about the participant. See :doc:`Enrolling a Participant <enrolling-a-volunteer>`.

Enrolling volunteer participants is a customizable feature of Onyx.
If your study accepts volunteers, participant managers will see the Enroll volunteer button in the upper right corner of the **Participants** page. See :ref:`this figure <enroll-volunteer-button-in-the-participants-page>`.
