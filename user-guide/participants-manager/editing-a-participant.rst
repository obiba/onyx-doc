|proc| Editing a participant's registration information
=======================================================
After a participant has been received or enrolled, a participant manager can edit their registration information.
It is potentially dangerous to change a participant's registration information after their interview has been started.
For example, changing the participant's gender could cause a problem since some physical measurements and questionnaires depend on it. Onyx does not prevent you from creating this kind of problem.
Each study defines the registration information that is stored for a participant.
Certain key information (such as the participant's name and ID numbers) cannot be changed after the participant was received or enrolled. Other information can be modified.

Prerequisites

You must be an Onyx user of type participant manager
