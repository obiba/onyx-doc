|proc| Enrolling a volunteer participant (customizable)
=======================================================
If your study accepts volunteer participants, a participant manager can enroll them as explained in this section.
You will have to assign a Participant ID number, the number that will be used to track the participant during the interview and, will probably be used to track their data for the duration of the study.
It is important to review the list of participants carefully when registering a new participant and assigning them a Participant ID.

Prerequisites
-------------
* You must be an Onyx user of type participant manager
* Your study accepts volunteer participants. The **Enroll volunteer** button is displayed in the **Participants** page as shown in :ref:`this figure <enroll-volunteer-button-in-the-participants-page>`.
* You must be prepared to assign a new Participant ID to the participant.

Each study determines how it will assign Participant IDs: either by scanning a barcode, by manually entering a number in a certain format and from a certain series of numbers, or by automatically generating an ID.

Procedure
---------
#. If the **Participants** page is not displayed, select the **Participants** tab to display it. The **Enroll volunteer** button is displayed in the upper right corner.(see :ref:`this figure <enroll-volunteer-button-in-the-participants-page>`).
#. | Select the **Enroll volunteer** button. The **Volunteer Registration** page is displayed. See :ref:`this figure <the-volunteer-registration-page>`.
   | The fields you see were defined by your study and may differ from those shown in :ref:`this figure <the-volunteer-registration-page>`.

#. If your study requires that you check a photo ID of the participant, now would be a convenient time to do so.
#. Complete the fields. Required fields are indicated with an asterisk. You can scan a barcode to obtain a participant ID or enter a value manually.
#. If you decide not to enroll the participant, select the **Cancel** button. The **Volunteer Registration** page closes and the **Participants** page is redisplayed unchanged.
#. | If you want to go ahead with enrolling the participant, select the **Save** button. The **Volunteer Registration** page closes and the **Participants** page is redisplayed.
