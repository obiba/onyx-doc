Interview page
==============
When you find a participant and click their **Interview** link, the **Interview** page is displayed.
This page gives you an overview of a participant's interview and shows the status of each interview stage.
It is from this page that you start working on each stage of an interview and to which you are returned after a stage is complete.
:ref:`This figure <the-interview-page>` shows the **Interview** page and points out some of its more important features.

   The Interview page

Here are the important features of the **Interview** page:

.. _interview-exit-buttons:

* | **Interview Exit buttons**. The **Exit X** and the **Exit this interview** button both close the **Interview** page properly
  | they release the lock that was put on the interview when you entered the **Interview** page. See Obtaining a Lock on an Interview.
  | You can select either **Exit** button when you need to leave the Interview page before the interview is complete.
  | They can be used at any time and do not affect the status of the interview.
  | Some examples of when you would exit an interview (using either of these buttons):
  | After you complete a stage and need to take a break
  | After you view the state of the participant's interview for information purposes
  | When you have finished the stages for which you are responsible and are ready to pass the participant over to another staff member
  | The two Exit buttons function in exactly the same way---there are two of them for convenience sake.

  + After you complete a stage and need to take a break
  + After you complete a stage and need to take a break
  + After you complete a stage and need to take a break

* | The **Onyx Exit button** (the **X** in the upper right corner of the Onyx window---:ref:`see this figure <the-interview-page>`) is not the same as the **Interview Exit** buttons.
  | If you select the **Onyx Exit button** while in the **Interview** page, Onyx will close immediately without releasing your lock on the interview.
  | The next time anyone (including you) looks for the participant in the **Participants** list, a lock will be displayed on the interview.
  | A participant manager will have to unlock the interview. See :ref:`Unlocking an Interview <unlocking-an-interview>`.
* | **Close** button — You select this button if you need to end the interview early (before all stages are complete), but do not need to withdraw the participant from the study.
  | **CAUTION**: If you select **Close**, you will not be able to resume the interview.
  | Each study defines what will be done with the data acquired to the point of stopping an interview in this way.
* | **Print Reports** button — Each study can define one or more reports that can be printed and given to the participant.
  | You can select this button after any stage of an interview. It allows you to print reports as you go along rather than waiting until all stages are complete.
* | **Cancel** — You select this button if you need to cancel the interview and withdraw the participant from the study.
  | **CAUTION**: If you select **Cancel**, you will not be able to resume the interview.
  | Each study defines what will be done with the data acquired to the point of cancelling the interview.

  | You can also view a list of user comments only for a particular stage.
