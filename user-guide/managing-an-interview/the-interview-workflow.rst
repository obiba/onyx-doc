The interview workflow broken down into steps
=============================================
Due to Onyx's highly customizable nature, we cannot tell you which stages you will see when you enter the **Interview** page or the exact names of the stage statuses and stage actions that you will see, but we can tell you--more or less--what you will do each time you enter the **Interview** page.

Basic Workflow
--------------
The basic workflow of an interview is as follows:
#. | **Enter the Interview page**. You enter the **Interview** page. You look at the list of stages and determine the next stage that must be done.
   | Consent is usually the first stage. If it hasn't been obtained, you must obtain it.
#. | **Start a Stage**. You start a stage. You would usually do the next stage that is "ready" and has a "start" action available for it.
   | Depending on how your study customized Onyx, an action window may be displayed when you select a stage action (start, pause, resume, and so on).
   | If an action window is displayed, you must complete it to confirm your identity and the identity of the participant, and, in some cases, to enter a comment explaining why the action was necessary.
#. | **Work your Way through the Stage**. When you are inside a stage, you follow the directions displayed onscreen to collect the data required for the stage.
   | You step through the pages of the stage by selecting the **Next** and **Previous** buttons. If you need to pause or cancel the stage, you select the **Administration** button.
