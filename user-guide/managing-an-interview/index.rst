Managing an Interview
=====================
Interviewing a participant in Onyx is a multiple stage process. You enter and control the interview from one place, the Interview page, which gives you access to all the stages of the interview for a particular participant.
Interview stages include everything from signing a consent form to concluding the interview. Most stages are questionnaires, collection of biospecimens, and physical measurements.
Due to Onyx's high degree of customizability, this chapter cannot cover the actual stages defined by your study.
Instead, this chapter covers the features and procedures that allow you to start an interview, to work your way through the stages of the interview, and to end an interview a safe way in various circumstances.
By safe, we mean, so that you do not lose any data that you have collected.
This chapter covers these topics:

* The :doc:`Interview page <interview-page>` and its important features
* :doc:`Key concepts <key-concepts>` related to the interview workflow
* :doc:`The interview workflow broken down into steps <the-interview-workflow>`
* :doc:`Routine procedures at the interview level <routine-procedures-interview>`
* :doc:`Routine procedures at the stage level <routine-procedures-stage>`
* :doc:`Procedures for unusual situations <procedures-for-unusual-situations>`
