Introduction
============
A system administrator has all the permissions of the other two user roles (data collector (page 4) and participant manager (page 4)), as well as a few additional permissions.
This section covers those additional permissions. In particular, it covers:

* :doc:`Key concepts <key-concepts>` of interest to system administrators
* :doc:`Installation <installation>`
* :doc:`Server configuration <server-configuration>`
* :doc:`Workstation configuration <workstation-configuration>`
* :ref:`Procedures <admin-Procedures>` (in the Onyx user interface) that can only be done by system administrators:
   + Adding an Onyx user (page 140)
   + Editing the profile of an Onyx user (page 140) (including password reset)
   + Activating and deactivating Onyx users (page 141)
   + Deleting an Onyx user (page 141)
   + Exporting data (page 142) (participant data, as well as data about instruments and experimental conditions)
   + Purging data (participant data only)
